# blurry-plugin-blur-blurry-name

(I apologize for the naming of this plugin.)

## Introduction

This is a [Blurry](https://github.com/blurry-dev/blurry) plugin used in the Blurry documentation site to wrap 'Blurry' in a `<span class="blurry">`.

This plugin _may_ be good for a laugh, but it can be used as an example of how to author a Blurry plugin and how to write a [Mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune/) plugin with Python type hints.

## Installation

This plugin is currently not published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed directly from this repo.
